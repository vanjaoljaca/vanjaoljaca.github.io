## Jun 18 2023 - Jun 25

Today I am brainstorming things I want to have the ability to do (muscle memory style) at some recent point in the future.

### Video

- [x] Move a video from phone to laptop



### ChatGPT

- [x] Write a plugin
- [x] Merge API & web domains (evaluate domains)
- [x] Invoke a direct json function
- [x] Use GPT-Engineer to make something [Attempted, Need GPT4]
- [ ] Auto export conversations / import to vanjacloud => generative
- [ ] Text based agent environment (multi agent interaction)
- [ ] Fine-tune a model

What if the blog was a short intro / description, and the rest of the blog was a chatgpt discussion?

Talk about goals:

First 3-5 small projects for attention

Then commit to something medium (expose something I find of value)

Then maybe another attention project to redirect attention on main project



Attention is good for motivation and enforcing progress

Build in public helps motivate with carrot & stick
